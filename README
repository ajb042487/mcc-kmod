This is an out-of-tree kernel module which implements Freescale's
Multi-Core Communication for Vybrid SoC's.

This repository contains changes which allow the kernel module to
work with newer kernels which use IRQ domains and virtual IRQ
numbers. However, some custom kernel symbols are required to access
the CPU2CPU interrupts of Vybrid's MSCM module:
- mscm_request_cpu2cpu_irq
- mscm_free_cpu2cpu_irq
- mscm_trigger_cpu2cpu_irq
- mscm_enable_cpu2cpu_irq
- mscm_disable_cpu2cpu_irq

The kernel provided by Toradex implements those symbols. See also
Toradex official git repository:
http://git.toradex.com/

To build the kernel module the source code of the kernel which the
module will be loaded into is required. Use the argument -C to
specify the location of the sources:
$ make -C ../path/to/kernel-source/ M=$PWD
